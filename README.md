XPages Log Files Reader (http://www.openntf.org/internal/home.nsf/project.xsp?action=openDocument&name=XPages%20Log%20File%20Reader)

When developing XPages you need access to the log files on order to debug your application. 
Typically you don't have access to these file when running on a server - until now! The XPages Log File Reader retrieves all the log from the server and displays them in a webpage.
Currently these files are supported: 
Log.nsf
All the files in the IBM_TECHNICAL_SUPPORT folder, e.g. the console.log and xpages.log
Error and Trace logs in the domino\workspace\logs folder
Startup.log
Additional you will have access to read all the relevant server settings in these files:
notes.ini
xsp.properties
java.policy
rcpinstall.properties

Installation is easy: download, copy to server, sign and run :-)
